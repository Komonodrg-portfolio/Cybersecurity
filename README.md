# 👨‍💻 Cybersecurity

<h2>🌐 Overview</h2>
<h3>🔐 Cybersecurity: Defending the  Digital Age</h3>

Cybersecurity—a discipline that is no longer optional, and no longer just technical.

It is the backbone of the internet, the guardian of cloud infrastructure, and the first line of defense in every digital system we rely on today.

From personal data to national infrastructure, every byte that moves through the global network depends on cybersecurity to ensure it stays confidential, integral, and available.

<h3>🔧 Why Network Engineering Matters</h3>

🌐 Why Cybersecurity Is Foundational

The internet and cloud may seem like invisible forces we take for granted—but behind every “secure” transaction, login, or download is a web of technologies and people working tirelessly to protect it.

No digital system is safe unless it is secure.
Whether you're streaming content, managing a smart device, or deploying a global cloud service—cybersecurity is what keeps it running, and keeps it safe.

Every modern innovation—from AI and blockchain to healthcare systems and defense platforms—rests on the assurance of security. And that assurance is built by cyber security professionals.

<h2>🪂 <em>One Man's Thoughts...</em></h2>
A decade ago, it was at a very exciting time for me.  I was recently married and had a young infant at home.  I remember having a conversation with my father-in- law at the hospital the day she was born about how I was <b>NOW</b> planning on taking care of his first born Daughter and newly arrived Granddaughter.  Having been in a healthcare for a while and knowing my position's salary wasn't a feasible way to support a family longterm, I had a choice to make.  I'd always had a passion for gaming, and through working through solutions in my own home network over the years (opening NAT, port forwarding, etc) I already had an accidental but vested interest in Networking.  Making the plunge to commit to becoming a Network Engineer was an easy decision and one of the most life changing, pivotal choices I'm glad I made.  In that hospital cafeteria, I told him within 5 years I looked to become one, as I was currently in school at the time.  It took me 2.<br>

<br>

Obtaining my CCNA, first back in 2014, has allowed me not only live a life I'd only dreamed of as being the firstborn to immigrant parents.  It allowed my an opportunity to work in a field where my mind was always challenged and forced to learn and grow.  I truly believe and am a living testimony of the doors that are possible to walk through professionally by obtaining this certification.  If you have the drive, I say go for it!  The roads it will take you will be fundamentally assuring, financially sustaining, and will take you far in an ever changing IT landscape.  The roads will always be the roads, best to know how to navigate.  

<br>Colleagues, Onward.<br>
