# 👨‍💻 Cybersecurity

<h2>🌐 Overview</h2>
<h3>🔐 Cybersecurity: Defending the  Digital Age</h3>

Cybersecurity—a discipline that is no longer optional, and no longer just technical.

It is the backbone of the internet, the guardian of cloud infrastructure, and the first line of defense in every digital system we rely on today.

From personal data to national infrastructure, every byte that moves through the global network depends on cybersecurity to ensure it stays confidential, integral, and available.

 Why Network Engineering Matters</h3>

<h3>🔧 Why Cybersecurity Is Foundational</h3> 

The internet and cloud may seem like invisible forces we take for granted—but behind every “secure” transaction, login, or download is a web of technologies and people working tirelessly to protect it.

No digital system is safe unless it is secure.
Whether you're streaming content, managing a smart device, or deploying a global cloud service—cybersecurity is what keeps it running, and keeps it safe.

Every modern innovation—from AI and blockchain to healthcare systems and defense platforms—rests on the assurance of security. And that assurance is built by cyber security professionals.
